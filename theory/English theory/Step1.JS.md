JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browsers. Most websites use JavaScript and when things go wrong, web developers use the console to investigate errors.

The console is part of the web browser. Logging (writing) messages to the console is a good way to diagnose and troubleshoot minor issues in your code.

You can use console.log () to write or log messages. In the example code below, the message 'All good, no errors' is sent to the console.

console.log ('All good, no errors').

Text in JavaScript needs to be enclosed in quotes
console.log ('Testing in progress').
