# Step 1 #
JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browsers. Most websites use JavaScript and when things go wrong, web developers use the console to investigate errors.

In this lesson you'll learn about the web developer’s main weapon: the developer’s console.
Coding errors are not visible in the browser. Web developers use the console to test code and fix bugs.
The console is part of the web browser. Logging (writing) messages to the console is a good way to diagnose and troubleshoot minor issues in your code.

You can use console.log () to write or log messages. In the example code below, the message 'All good, no errors' is sent to the console.

console.log ('All good, no errors').

Text in JavaScript needs to be enclosed in quotes
console.log ('Testing in progress').

The Code Playground

Press on the code block to open the Code Playground, then press run to see the message in the console. The console with the message will open at the bottom of the page.
console.log ('My first console message').
The Code Playground has sections for the 3 core web technologies.
- HTML controls the structure of a web page.
- CSS controls the presentation and style of a web page.
In this lesson you’ll use the JavaScript section only.

## Output ##

Let's use JavaScript to print "Hello World" to the browser. This is what that would look like.
<script> 
  
document.write("Hello World!"); 
  
</script> 
Notice some extra stuff there? Nothing gets past you!

Time to introduce the document.write() function. This is what we need to use to write text into our HTML document.

Output to console
Right, we’re now experts in writing HTML output with document.write().
Time for a different type of output. Let’s learn about output to the browser console.

For this we’ll be needing the trusty console.log() function.

Wait, not so fast! What’s this console we’re talking about?

The console is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, run JavaScript code, and see errors and warnings.
It looks like this:

console.log("Hello!");
